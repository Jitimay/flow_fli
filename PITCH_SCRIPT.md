# FlowFli - IQAI Agent Arena Pitch Script (2:30)

## 🎬 **OPENING HOOK** (0:00-0:15)
*[Show water crisis statistics on screen]*

**"2 billion people lack access to clean water. What if AI could solve this crisis?"**

*[Cut to FlowFli dashboard showing real-time water management]*

**"Meet FlowFli - the world's first autonomous water management agent that doesn't just think... it acts."**

---

## 🚀 **THE PROBLEM** (0:15-0:30)
*[Show images of water scarcity, long queues at water stations]*

**"Traditional water distribution is broken. Manual control, fraud, waste, and no transparency. People suffer while resources are mismanaged."**

*[Show failed water systems, corruption statistics]*

**"We need intelligent, autonomous systems that can't be corrupted or manipulated."**

---

## 💡 **THE SOLUTION** (0:30-1:00)
*[Screen recording of FlowFli dashboard in action]*

**"FlowFli is an ADK-TS powered autonomous agent that revolutionizes water management."**

*[Show live demo - click purchase water button]*

**"Watch this: A user pays $2.50..."**

*[Show agent processing payment, fraud analysis, pump activation]*

**"The agent validates payment, runs fraud detection, and autonomously activates real hardware - an Arduino-controlled water pump."**

*[Show physical pump activation, water flowing]*

**"This isn't simulation. This is real water flowing based on AI decisions."**
